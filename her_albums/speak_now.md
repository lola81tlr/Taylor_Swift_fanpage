*Speak Now* is Taylor's third studio album. It was released on October 25 2010, through Big Machine Records.

Fun fact about this album: it is the only album in her discography that she wrote entirely by herself. At the moment, she was touring her second album [*Fearless*](/her_albums/fearless).

This album reflects her transition from adolescence to adulthood, and fans find it very relatable.

She toured this album from February 2011 to March 2012, and this is her first album to diverge from her previous country style.
