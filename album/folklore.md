## folklore — 2020

*folklore* is Taylor Swift’s unexpected journey into the quiet corners of her imagination. Released in July 2020, the album marked a striking departure from the glittering pop of *Lover* and *reputation*, introducing a muted, introspective sound rooted in indie folk and alternative rock. Written and recorded in isolation during the global pandemic, *folklore* unfolds like a collection of whispered stories — nostalgic, haunting, and deeply poetic.

The album’s sonic landscape was shaped by Swift’s collaboration with Aaron Dessner of The National and longtime partner Jack Antonoff. Its production features soft piano, gentle guitars, and subtle electronic textures, all serving as a backdrop for some of Swift’s most intricate storytelling. Through characters and narratives both real and imagined, she explores themes of memory, loss, love, and introspection.

Critically acclaimed for its lyricism and emotional depth, *folklore* became a defining record of its era — an album that traded spectacle for sincerity. It’s the sound of a songwriter at peace with stillness, finding meaning in the spaces between words.

**Writers / Co-writers:** Taylor Swift, Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, William Bowery (credited pseudonym for Joe Alwyn).
