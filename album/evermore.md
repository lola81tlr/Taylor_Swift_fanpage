## evermore — 2020

*evermore* serves as the natural continuation of *folklore*, a companion piece that expands on its quiet storytelling and introspective depth. Released in December 2020, the album explores the idea of moving forward while still carrying the weight of the past — a journey through emotional endurance, reflection, and growth. While *folklore* feels like dusk, *evermore* captures the chill of early winter mornings, when clarity begins to set in.

Collaborating once again with Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, and William Bowery, Swift crafted an album that feels both expansive and intimate. Piano and acoustic guitar intertwine with banjo and soft percussion, creating a rustic yet cinematic atmosphere in *evermore*. Lyrically, it blends vivid character sketches with personal revelations, revealing new dimensions of Swift’s storytelling.

The record invites listeners into tales of heartbreak, hope, betrayal, and redemption — proof that even in stillness, stories continue to bloom. *evermore* stands as a meditation on persistence, creativity, and the quiet beauty of carrying on.

**Writers / Co-writers:** Taylor Swift, Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, William Bowery, Justin Vernon.
